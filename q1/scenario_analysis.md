- Average response: 1,500 tokens (full article)
- Quality is more important than speed
- Budget: < $2,000/month

### Calculator Analysis

**Configuration Tested:**
- Model: 13B parameter model
- Hardware: A100 80GB
- Deployment: Single GPU
- Precision: FP16

**Results:**
```
💾 Memory Usage: 35.70 GB
⏱️  Latency: 57143.0 ms (57.1 seconds)
💰 Cost per Request: $0.065238
💸 Cost per Token: $0.00004349
🚀 Tokens/Second: 26.2
🔧 Compatible: ✅
📊 Memory Utilization: 44.6%
```

**Monthly Cost Analysis:**
- Cost per request: $0.065238
- Daily requests: 200
- Monthly cost: $0.065238 × 200 × 30 = $391.43/month

### Recommendations

✅ **Recommended Solution: 13B Model on A100 80GB**

**Pros:**
- Excellent content quality for marketing use
- Well within budget ($391/month vs $2,000)
- Good memory headroom for optimization
- Suitable latency for content generation (not real-time)

**Optimization Strategies:**
- **Increase Batch Size**: Process 4-8 requests together to improve throughput
- **Smart Scheduling**: Run generation jobs during off-peak hours
- **Template-based Generation**: Use structured prompts to reduce token usage

**Quality vs Cost Trade-offs:**
- **Upgrade to GPT-4**: For premium clients, use GPT-4 selectively
- **7B Alternative**: Could save ~60% cost with acceptable quality loss
- **Multi-GPU**: Consider if throughput becomes a bottleneck

## Scenario 3: Research Institution - Scientific Analysis

### Use Case Description
A university research lab needs to process scientific papers and generate analysis:
- 50 complex analysis requests per day
- Average prompt: 2,000 tokens (full paper abstracts + questions)
- Average response: 800 tokens (detailed analysis)
- Highest quality output required
- Budget: $5,000/month
- Occasional batch processing of 100+ papers

### Calculator Analysis

**Configuration Tested:**
- Model: GPT-4 equivalent
- Hardware: H100 (distributed setup)
- Deployment: Distributed (4 GPUs)
- Precision: FP16
- Batch size: 1

**Results:**
```
💾 Memory Usage: 2100.00 GB (distributed)
⏱️  Latency: 12571.4 ms (12.6 seconds)
💰 Cost per Request: $0.111905
💸 Cost per Token: $0.00013988
🚀 Tokens/Second: 63.6
🔧 Compatible: ❌ (requires distributed setup)
📊 Memory Utilization: 2625.0% (per GPU)
```

**Monthly Cost Analysis:**
- Cost per request: $0.111905
- Daily requests: 50
- Monthly cost: $0.111905 × 50 × 30 = $167.86/month

### Recommendations

✅ **Recommended Solution: Cloud API for GPT-4**

**Alternative Analysis - Cloud API:**
```python
# Using OpenAI API pricing
cost_per_1k_input_tokens = 0.03
cost_per_1k_output_tokens = 0.06

daily_input_tokens = 50 * 2000  # 100,000 tokens
daily_output_tokens = 50 * 800   # 40,000 tokens

daily_cost = (daily_input_tokens/1000 * 0.03) + (daily_output_tokens/1000 * 0.06)
monthly_cost = daily_cost * 30  # ~$132/month
```

**Pros:**
- Highest quality outputs for research
- No infrastructure management
- Excellent cost efficiency ($132-168/month vs $5,000 budget)
- Instant scalability for batch processing

**On-Premise Alternative:**
- **13B Model Cluster**: Deploy multiple 13B models for cost-effective high quality
- **Hybrid Approach**: Use cloud API for critical analyses, local models for preliminary work
- **Batch Optimization**: Process multiple papers simultaneously

**Recommendations for Budget Utilization:**
- **Premium Features**: Use saved budget for human expert review
- **Data Processing**: Invest in better data preprocessing and prompt engineering
- **Backup Solutions**: Maintain local 13B model for continued operation
