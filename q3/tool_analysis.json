    "explanation": "I have optimized the prompt for Cursor AI by focusing on its strengths in handling multi-step conversation and file-generating tasks. The prompt now emphasizes the need for creating a detailed plan for refactoring a project structure, including specific instructions for creating and updating files with code snippets in markdown format. This will help Cursor AI understand the desired file structure and code changes more effectively."
